# rebootControl

A modern take on controlling uptime across the enterprise

# Motivation

* We have a considerable investment in an existing reliable system that reboots all our servers & meets most of our needs, but it depends upon access to the vCenter API...
* ... and ca. ~Sept, 2023, our VM's are going to be transitioned into a VMWare environment to which we don't have the same level of access.
* So, we can't use our existing tooling!
